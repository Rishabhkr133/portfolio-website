                <h4 class="ABOUT ME">ABOUT ME </h4>
                <q>Hello guyz this is Rishabh kumar.Today i am gonna to tell you about a small sneakpeak of my life. I
                    am extremely enthusiastic about computer science. The ever-evolving nature of technology and the
                    endless possibilities it presents are what truly excite me. I find joy in coding, problem-solving,
                    and the creativity that comes with developing software and applications. The potential to create
                    innovative solutions that can make a real impact on people's</q>

                <h4 class="ABOUT ME">MY LIFE EXPERIENCE</h4>
                <q> An Experience that changed my Life Life is full of learning and it is mostly due to our daily life
                    experiences. These experiences are mostly based on our surrounding environment from where we learn
                    new things every day. But all these experiences are a result of our keen observations out of daily
                    routines. It is very important to note that life also provides us with some chances to experience
                    new people or places that are indeed out of the ordinar </q>

                <h4 class="ABOUT ME">AIM </h4>
                <q>It is a well-known fact that a person without an aim is a person without a life. All the creatures in
                    this universe have one or another specific aim. It is common for all things. As the human is the
                    best creature among them all, he has been given a right to select what he wants to do in his life.
                    The mindset of each and every person is of its own type. Therefore, his aim in life will also be
                    different from others. Having a good mindset in life is very much important </q>
